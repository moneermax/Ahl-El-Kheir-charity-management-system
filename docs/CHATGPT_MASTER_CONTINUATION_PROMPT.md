# Ahl El Kheir — Continuation Rules

## Start here

Read the canonical documentation first:
1. AHL_EL_KHEIR_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md
2. AHL_EL_KHEIR_ARCHITECTURE_AND_DATA_MODEL.md
3. AHL_EL_KHEIR_ROLES_AND_WORKFLOWS.md
4. AHL_EL_KHEIR_EMPLOYEE_TASKS_AND_USER_GUIDE.md
5. AHL_EL_KHEIR_OPERATIONS_SECURITY.md
6. AHL_EL_KHEIR_DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md

Then inspect the relevant source, schema and domain evidence.

## Current boundary — 2026-10-05

Projects Phase 5 controlled PRJ-0015 reconciliation and financial closure is runtime verified and closed. Do not recreate the fixture or repeat the return.

HR Salary Advance Stages 1–5 are complete at their documented acceptance boundary. Stage 6 — Direct Repayment & Settlement — remains NOT STARTED and must not be implemented unless explicitly opened as the next agreed work unit.

Fina core settlement acceptance is complete at its documented boundary.

## Non-negotiable rules

- Existing project only; do not rebuild.
- main only; do not create branches for routine work.
- Never use reset --hard, clean, restore-to-discard, or force-push.
- Inspect actual source/schema before changes.
- Never invent tables, columns, statuses, roles or accounts.
- No runtime CREATE/ALTER.
- No triggers/views/stored procedures/functions/events.
- Server-side authorization is the security boundary.
- Preserve historical accounting evidence.
- Test only against a documented risk or regression.
- Update canonical documentation after meaningful changes.

## Engineering method

Inspect -> Understand -> Verify -> Identify risk -> Fix narrowly -> Test -> Document.


## Latest HR checkpoint — 2026-10-05

The employee salary register is implemented at `modules/hr/employees.php?action=salary_register`.

Rules:
- use the earliest positive salary-history row per employee;
- ignore the automatic 0.00 provisioning placeholder;
- current salary values are database-only development/test data;
- include only employment states with `category = 'working'` and `is_active = 1`;
- do not delete or alter historical HR/payroll/accounting evidence for employees who become non-working.

Latest source commit: `b8adb067c3de34441192e63fff56c6b707b3aa22`.

When continuing, pull/inspect the current `main` state first. Do not assume the next task from chat history; identify it from the current canonical documents and the user's new requirement.

## Latest HR attendance checkpoint — 2026-10-05

A policy-driven employee attendance foundation is implemented. Do not replace it with hard-coded hours or create a second attendance subsystem. Implementation files: database/migrations/2026-10-05_hr_attendance_policy.sql, modules/hr/lib_attendance_policy.php, modules/hr/attendance_policy.php, index.php login integration, tools/finalize_daily_attendance.php. Existing modules/hr/lib_attendance_integrity.php remains authoritative for employment-state and approved-leave eligibility.

V1 policy controls working start/end, attendance cutoff, absence finalization, automatic login attendance, automatic absence and default work mode. Example/default values are remote work, 07:00–16:00, but these are policy data. Qualifying login creates today's present record and preserves the first check-in; non-working and approved-leave employees are excluded; employees who never log in require the scheduled finalizer; the finalizer is idempotent and never overwrites an existing daily row.

Runtime status: STATICALLY IMPLEMENTED — RUNTIME VERIFICATION PENDING. First apply/verify the migration and complete the login/finalizer runtime gate before adding late-arrival, shifts, weekends, holidays or other advanced attendance rules.

Salary Advance boundary: Stages 1–5 are closed at the documented acceptance boundary. Stage 6 Direct Repayment & Settlement remains NOT STARTED unless explicitly opened by the user.
