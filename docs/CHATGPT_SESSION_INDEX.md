## Current continuation point — 2026-10-05

Projects Phase 5 is closed after full controlled reconciliation and financial closure.

Do not repeat closed fixtures without regression evidence. Continue from the next genuinely open engineering or audit item.

## Working rule

Repository source, schema and later verified evidence outrank chat history and older checkpoint text.


### HR checkpoint — 2026-10-05

The HR employee salary register is implemented and refined:
- first positive salary-history value is used instead of the mutable current salary;
- the automatic 0.00 provisioning placeholder is ignored;
- current varied salary values are database test data only;
- non-working employment states are excluded from the current register using `hr_employment_states.category = 'working'` and `is_active = 1`;
- historical HR/payroll/accounting evidence remains preserved.

Latest related implementation commit: `b8adb067c3de34441192e63fff56c6b707b3aa22`.

The next session should inspect the current `main` state and identify the next concrete HR/accounting/reporting requirement rather than changing salary-register data again without a business reason.

### HR attendance policy checkpoint — 2026-10-05

Attendance policy foundation is implemented on main. Rules are versioned in hr_attendance_policy_versions; administration is modules/hr/attendance_policy.php; successful-login integration is in index.php through modules/hr/lib_attendance_policy.php; automatic absence is tools/finalize_daily_attendance.php. Default/example values are remote work, 07:00–16:00, stored as policy data. Canonical attendance eligibility remains based on employment state and approved leave.

Status: source implementation complete; migration application and runtime verification pending. Next gate: apply the migration, create/verify the first effective policy, test qualifying login, verify repeated login preserves the first check-in, verify non-working/approved-leave exclusions, and execute the finalizer idempotently.


## 2026-10-05 — Attendance Policy ↔ Payroll Deduction Integration
Attendance and payroll policies are intentionally separate but coordinated. The **attendance policy is the source of attendance facts** (working hours, working days, automatic login attendance, absence finalization and work mode); the **payroll policy is the source of monetary treatment** (whether absence/unpaid leave are deductible and the applicable percentage). Payroll must never infer an absence merely because an attendance row is missing.

The integration now adds `payroll.attendance_deduction` as a separate payroll component. Draft payroll refresh calculates it from authoritative attendance/approved-leave records, using the payroll record's linked payroll-policy version and the attendance policy effective on each calendar date. Working days come from the effective attendance policy; non-working days produce no automatic absence and no attendance-derived deduction. Approved paid leave produces no deduction; approved unpaid leave uses the payroll policy's unpaid-leave percentage; an explicit attendance `absent` row uses the payroll policy's absence percentage. Missing attendance rows are not treated as absence. Late/early-departure monetary deductions remain disabled until their policy contains sufficient threshold/rate semantics.

Salary-advance payroll integration remains downstream: attendance deduction reduces the eligible salary before salary-advance deduction when the salary-advance policy uses `net_before_advance`. The salary-advance component remains separate and continues to be bounded by its own policy/schedule. No salary-advance accounting semantics were changed. Existing zero attendance-deduction behavior remains unchanged for payrolls without attendance-derived deductions.

The payroll UI displays **general deductions**, **attendance deduction**, and **salary-advance deduction** separately. Posted payrolls are immutable; attendance changes after payroll approval do not retroactively rewrite the posted payroll. Draft payrolls can be refreshed before approval.

Migration: `database/migrations/2026-10-05_hr_attendance_payroll_integration.sql` adds `attendance_deduction` to payroll and `working_days` to attendance-policy versions. Runtime verification of the new cross-policy path is pending on the local XAMPP/MariaDB environment.


## 2026-10-05 — Same-page POST navigation remediation

A repository-level audit confirmed that many operational pages use same-path HTTP POST forms that submit as full-document browser navigations. The previous `akGlobalScrollRestore` mechanism only repaired the viewport after that navigation and therefore could not eliminate the underlying visible jump.

Implemented on `main`:
- `assets/js/app.js`: centralized same-path POST interception using `fetch()`, replacing only the shared `.content` region and preserving the existing viewport; cross-page redirects remain normal navigations.
- `modules/hr/attendance.php`: attendance bulk refresh now uses the centralized in-place refresh; return-from-leave confirmation now re-enters the normal submit event so the centralized handler can process it.
- `includes/header.php`: removed the obsolete first-paint scroll-restoration guard because same-page POSTs are now kept in the existing document.

Commits: `412301e82718dba9a96146b4b9b42c4298469619`, `c7ade0903bf3aefbeed2d0e272c91a889d19038c`, `9e2e781ba465fd0c3ab4bdd41f0ac4e52f1b5b84`.

**Verification status:** code/repository review completed; local browser runtime verification is still required before marking the issue closed. Do not treat the change as runtime-verified until the attendance and representative same-page POST workflows are tested locally.
