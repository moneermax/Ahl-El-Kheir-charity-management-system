## Current continuation point — 2026-10-05

Projects Phase 5 is closed after full controlled reconciliation and financial closure.

Do not repeat closed fixtures without regression evidence. Continue from the next genuinely open engineering or audit item.

## Working rule

Repository source, schema and later verified evidence outrank chat history and older checkpoint text.


### HR checkpoint — 2026-10-05

The HR employee salary register is implemented and refined:
- first positive salary-history value is used instead of the mutable current salary;
- the automatic 0.00 provisioning placeholder is ignored;
- current varied salary values are database test data only;
- non-working employment states are excluded from the current register using `hr_employment_states.category = 'working'` and `is_active = 1`;
- historical HR/payroll/accounting evidence remains preserved.

Latest related implementation commit: `b8adb067c3de34441192e63fff56c6b707b3aa22`.

The next session should inspect the current `main` state and identify the next concrete HR/accounting/reporting requirement rather than changing salary-register data again without a business reason.
