# Ahl El Kheir Mobile App — Continuation

Checkpoint: 2026-10-24
Repository: `moneermax/Ahl-El-Kheir-charity-management-system`
Branch: `main`
Status: API authentication foundation source added; local PHP syntax/runtime verification and migration application are still required.

## Product direction

- Build a polished Flutter application for Android and iOS inside this existing repository.
- Preserve the current procedural PHP backend and MariaDB/MySQL database as the source of truth.
- Arabic-first UI with Arabic/English toggle and correct RTL/LTR layout.
- Existing role permissions, record-level scopes, and business workflows remain authoritative. A role returned by login is informational for navigation only; every data endpoint must enforce server-side authorization and existing scope rules.
- Keep XAMPP for local development. InfinityFree Free may block native API requests behind its browser verification layer; do not bypass hosting controls. The API must remain host-portable, and remote mobile testing should use an API-compatible HTTPS host.
- Do not expose XAMPP directly to the public internet.

## Initial API slice

- `api/v1/_bootstrap.php`: JSON response helpers, bounded JSON input, bearer parsing, live account/role lookup, token expiry/revocation checks.
- `api/v1/auth/login.php`: verifies existing username/password hashes, active-account state and password-change requirement; records existing successful-login side effects; issues a random opaque bearer token.
- `api/v1/auth/me.php`: returns the current live account identity and role from the database.
- `api/v1/auth/logout.php`: revokes the current token.
- `database/migrations/2026-10-24_mobile_api_sessions.sql`: dedicated token store; the legacy browser `user_sessions` table remains unchanged.
- Tokens are 32 random bytes; only SHA-256 hashes are stored. Initial access-token lifetime is 12 hours. The client must store tokens in platform secure storage and clear them on sign-out/expiry.

## Important current limits

- No refresh-token flow, password-reset/change API, persistent login throttling, device/session-management UI, or account-wide mobile-session revocation endpoint is included in this first slice.
- The API does not yet expose business-module data. Do not treat a successful login as permission to access any module.
- The mobile API migration has not been applied to any database. Do not run the endpoints until the migration is explicitly applied to the intended development database.
- PHP 8.2 syntax checks for all four API PHP files passed in the existing sponsor-scanner GitHub Actions workflow on commit `20fda29d99c8fe57995aee165f2fa166ded1e2c6`. Local runtime requests, token expiry/revocation tests, mobile app builds, and remote-host compatibility remain unverified.
- Review token lifetime and brute-force/rate-limiting controls before production deployment.

## Local verification plan

1. Pull `main` and run PHP 8.2 syntax checks on the four new API PHP files.
2. Review and apply the migration manually to the local `ahl_el_kheir` database only after taking the normal development backup and confirming the target DB.
3. Test login success/failure, inactive account, password-change-required account, `/me`, logout revocation, expired token, changed role/disabled account, and malformed/oversized JSON.
4. Confirm no raw token is stored in the database and no API request creates or alters schema.
5. Confirm the website browser login/session still works unchanged.
6. After local verification, build the Flutter shell and connect only to these verified API routes.

## API routes in this slice

- `POST /api/v1/auth/login.php` JSON body: `{"username":"…","password":"…"}`
- `GET /api/v1/auth/me.php` header: `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`
- `POST /api/v1/auth/logout.php` header: `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`

Responses use `{"ok":true,"data":...}` or `{"ok":false,"error":{"code":"…","message":"…"}}`. Always use HTTPS outside local development.

## Flutter foundation added (2026-10-24)

- Added `mobile/ahl_el_kheir_app/` with a Flutter manifest, a minimal Arabic-first login screen, Arabic/English toggle, RTL/LTR direction, secure bearer-token storage, session restoration, logout, and a minimal signed-in screen.
- The client targets the existing `api/v1/auth/login.php`, `me.php`, and `logout.php` routes. It does not expose business data or make client-side role checks an authorization boundary.
- A temporary API/network failure during session restoration now preserves the token; explicit 401/403 responses clear it.
- The source has not yet been compiled, analyzed, tested, or run on Android/iOS. Flutter platform scaffolding must be generated locally and dependencies resolved.
- Canonical master documents were restored from parent commit `8193a2b32443482cd26fe36c8f1123d8bc374292` after a previous edit accidentally truncated them. Their historical contents are preserved.



## GitHub Actions Flutter Android build (2026-10-24)

- Added `.github/workflows/build-flutter-mobile-app.yml` on `main`. It provisions Flutter/Java on a GitHub-hosted runner, generates Android platform scaffolding in the runner workspace (without overwriting the PHP app or the checked-in Dart source), runs `flutter pub get`, `flutter analyze`, the widget smoke test, and builds an Android debug APK artifact.
- Artifact name: `ahl-el-kheir-flutter-android-debug-apk`; retention is 30 days.
- The workflow runs for relevant pushes to `main` and supports manual dispatch with an `api_base_url` input. The default is the Android emulator URL `http://10.0.2.2:8081/AhlElKheir/api/v1`; physical-phone testing requires the computer's reachable LAN URL, while hosted APIs must use HTTPS.
- Cleartext HTTP is enabled only in the generated debug manifest for local testing. Do not make an HTTP release build or expose XAMPP publicly.
- Added `mobile/ahl_el_kheir_app/test/login_screen_test.dart` as a minimal Arabic login-screen smoke test.
- Initial source commits: workflow `a523843ef93912d8759b4ba6174ba2c6680968ca`, smoke test `55a6daa1aa6cb3251e92a7193192801a1bb086ab`; workflow host configurability update `848e819729a10545470648757ffab32bbcdfd90c`.

**Build status at documentation time: PENDING GitHub Actions completion.** Do not claim the APK compiled until the matching workflow run succeeds and its artifact is present. APK build success does not prove API runtime/authentication. The mobile API migration has not been applied and API security/runtime acceptance remains pending.


## Flutter widget-test correction (2026-10-24)

- GitHub Actions run 40060794073 confirmed dependency resolution and Dart analysis passed, but the widget test failed before APK build.
- The failed test launched the entire AhlElKheirApp and immediately expected the login form. App startup first performs asynchronous FlutterSecureStorage session restoration, so that UI test was coupled to a platform-storage startup path it did not need to validate.
- Corrected mobile/ahl_el_kheir_app/test/login_screen_test.dart to mount the actual LoginPage directly inside MaterialApp with RTL directionality. This isolates the test to the Arabic login form without changing production behavior just to satisfy a test.
- Correction commit: b3216456948e71a80ae2629961efc78352769edf. The subsequent GitHub Actions run must pass the test and publish the APK before build success can be claimed. API runtime/authentication remains unverified.


## 2026-10-24 — Physical-phone API URL and original branding correction

- User confirmed the phone-testing host is laptop LAN IP `192.168.18.9` and Apache port `881`, matching the prior QR-scanner setup. Flutter default and manual workflow default now use `http://192.168.18.9:881/AhlElKheir/api/v1`; this is for the current local network only and can change if the IP changes.
- Reworked the Flutter login and signed-in shell to use the website's navy palette (`#0A1F44`, `#1F4E8C`), Arabic RTL-first branded card layout, improved field/button styling, and the actual organization logo source. The build workflow copies the existing website asset `assets/img/logo.jpg` into Flutter assets before dependency resolution/tests/build; it does not create a replacement logo.
- Updated API URL does not itself prove connectivity or successful login. Phone and PC must share the network, Windows Firewall must permit Apache on port 881, and the URL must be reachable from the phone. The `mobile_api_sessions` migration is still not confirmed applied to `ahl_el_kheir`; do not use real credentials until migration and local API/runtime/security checks pass.
- Verification status: source change committed; GitHub Actions analysis/test/build and artifact upload pending. Physical-device UI and HTTP checks remain pending.
